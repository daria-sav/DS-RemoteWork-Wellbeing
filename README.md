## Database:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health/data
## Project Description
This project analyzes the impact of remote work on mental health using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes information on demographics, work conditions, and mental health metrics of remote workers. The project aims to identify key factors influencing mental health in remote work settings and provide actionable recommendations for employers to promote employee well-being.

## Project Goals
Goal 1: Identify key factors influencing the mental health of remote workers.
This will allow to develop recommendations for improving working conditions and preventing mental illness.
Goal 2: Identify groups that are least and most satisfied with the remote work experience.
This can help determine which types of workers need additional support and which practices promote employee well-being.
Goal 3: Create a visualization of stress levels associated with remote work across different professions.
* Identify key factors influencing the mental health of remote workers.
* Develop actionable recommendations for employers to mitigate stress and prevent mental health issues in remote employees.
* Understand the demographics and professional groups that are most and least satisfied with remote work.


- Step 1: Preparation

- Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, download it from the official website (python.org) and install it.
- Open the terminal (or command prompt) and install the necessary libraries with the command:
  pip install joblib numpy pandas imblearn

- Download the files Model.py, ConvertingDataToNumeric.py, FileForWorkingWithModel.py, and Impact_of_Remote_Work_on_Mental_Health.csv.
- Place all files in the same folder.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the folder with the files using the cd command:
  cd /path/to/folder/with/files

- Step 2: Running the scripts

- Run the file ConvertingDataToNumeric.py with the command:
  python ConvertingDataToNumeric.py

- Run the file Model.py with the command:
  python Model.py

- Run the file FileForWorkingWithModel.py with the command:
  python FileForWorkingWithModel.py

- Step 3: Data entry

- The FileForWorkingWithModel.py script will ask you questions about your data.
- Carefully answer the questions by entering values into the terminal according to the instructions in parentheses.
- Step 4: Result

- After you have answered all the questions, the model will make a prediction about your mental state and display the result in the terminal.
