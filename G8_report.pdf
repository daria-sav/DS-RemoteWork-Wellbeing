Task 2. Business understanding 

 

1. Identifying Business Goals 

Background: 

Remote work has become a norm across industries, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a significant shift in workplace dynamics. While it has provided flexibility and reduced commuting, remote work has also posed challenges to employees’ mental health, such as increased stress, isolation, and difficulty balancing work and personal life. Understanding these impacts is crucial to developing actionable strategies for improving remote work conditions and promoting mental well-being among employees. 


Business Goals: 

- Identify the key factors influencing the mental health of remote workers, such as workload, social support, and work-life balance. 

- Develop actionable recommendations for employers to mitigate stress and prevent mental health issues in remote employees. 

- Understand the demographics and professional groups that are most and least satisfied with remote work, enabling tailored interventions. 

Business Success Criteria: 

- Deliver a comprehensive report that outlines findings and provides actionable recommendations for employers and HR teams. 

- Create clear visualizations that illustrate the correlation between stress levels and remote work conditions across different professions and demographics.

The objective of this project is to analyze the impact of remote work on mental health. For this, the data must include information related to: 

  

Demographics: Age, gender, region. 

  

Professional details: Job role, industry, years of experience, work location. 

  

Work metrics: Hours worked per week, number of virtual meetings. 

  

Mental health and well-being: Stress level, mental health condition, social isolation rating, work-life balance rating, access to mental health resources. 

  

Additional factors: Sleep quality, physical activity, productivity change, satisfaction with remote work, company support for remote work. 

  

Verify Data Availability 

  

The dataset available from Kaggle contains 14 MB of relevant data, fulfilling the requirements. This dataset includes the columns specified in the project’s background, ensuring availability of the necessary variables for analysis. 

  

 

 

Define Selection Criteria 

  

Include data points with valid and non-missing values for critical columns: “Stress_Level,” “Mental_Health_Condition,” and “Work_Life_Balance_Rating.” 

  

Focus on respondents engaged in remote work (filter rows where “Work_Location” equals “Remote” or similar). 

  

Ensure a balance in representation across demographic and professional groups for meaningful insights. 

  

Exclude data points with unrealistic or extreme outliers (like: 100+ hours worked per week). 

  

Describing Data 

  

The dataset consists of the following columns: 

  

Employee_ID: Unique identifier for each respondent. 

  

Age: Age of the respondent. 

  

Gender: Self-identified gender. 

  

Job_Role: The professional role of the respondent. 

  

Industry: The industry in which the respondent is employed. 

  

Years_of_Experience: Total professional experience in years. 

  

Work_Location: Indicates whether work is remote or hybrid.

Exploring Data 

  

Key Findings 

  

Demographics: Initial exploration shows balanced representation across genders but potential skew in some regions or industries. 

  

Work Metrics: Most respondents report working 30-50 hours per week. Outliers include individuals working more than 70 hours weekly. 

  

Mental Health: Stress levels and social isolation ratings show variability, with a noticeable percentage reporting high stress (4-5) and isolation. 

  

Company Support: Satisfaction with remote work and company support for remote work correlates positively with work-life balance ratings. 

  

Preliminary Statistics 

  

Age: Median = 35 years; Range = 22-65 years. 

  

Stress Level: Mean = 3.2; SD = 1.1. 

  

Work Hours: Mean = 42 hours/week; SD = 10.5 hours. 

  

Relationships 

  

A preliminary scatter plot of “Work_Life_Balance_Rating” vs. “Stress_Level” indicates a negative correlation. 

  

Grouping by “Industry” shows variations in satisfaction with remote work, suggesting industry-specific interventions may be necessary. 

  

Verifying Data Quality: 

Completeness 

  

Critical Columns: Columns like “Stress_Level” and “Mental_Health_Condition” have minimal missing data less than 5%. 

  

Demographic Fields: Slightly higher missing values almost 10% in “Region” and “Years_of_Experience.” 

  

Consistency 

  

The dataset appears consistent in categorical fields. 

  

Some inconsistencies observed in numeric columns (“Hours_Worked_Per_Week” has a few entries exceeding 100.) 

  

Accuracy 

  

Self-reported data introduces potential biases, such as underreporting of stress levels or overreporting of productivity changes. 

  

Verification with external datasets (if feasible) can strengthen reliability. 

  

Outliers 

  

Notable outliers in “Hours_Worked_Per_Week” and “Sleep_Quality” require further investigation to avoid skewing the analysis. 

 Ethical Considerations 

  

Ensure anonymization of all identifiers. 

Avoid aggregating data in ways that may indirectly expose individual identities, especially in small demographic groups. 

  

Decision on Data Usage 

  

Include all fields initially, focusing on filtering for relevant data. 

  

Perform additional cleaning and transformations in the data preparation step to handle outliers and missing data effectively. 

  

Exclude fields with excessive missing or unreliable data if no imputation method is appropriate. 

  

Conclusion 

  

The dataset offers a comprehensive basis for analysis of remote work’s impact on mental health. Preliminary exploration confirms the feasibility of achieving the business and data-mining goals, with some considerations for handling missing data, outliers, and potential biases during subsequent steps.
