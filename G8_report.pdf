## Task 2. Business understanding

## 1. Identifying Business Goals

### Background:
Remote work has become a norm across industries, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a significant shift in workplace dynamics. While it has provided flexibility and reduced commuting, remote work has also posed challenges to employees’ mental health, such as increased stress, isolation, and difficulty balancing work and personal life. Understanding these impacts is crucial to developing actionable strategies for improving remote work conditions and promoting mental well-being among employees.

### Business Goals:
1. Identify the key factors influencing the mental health of remote workers, such as workload, social support, and work-life balance.
2. Develop actionable recommendations for employers to mitigate stress and prevent mental health issues in remote employees.
3. Understand the demographics and professional groups that are most and least satisfied with remote work, enabling tailored interventions.

### Business Success Criteria:
- Deliver a comprehensive report that outlines findings and provides actionable recommendations for employers and HR teams.
- Create clear visualizations that illustrate the correlation between stress levels and remote work conditions across different professions and demographics.

## 2. Assessing the Situation

### Inventory of Resources:
- **Data:** Kaggle dataset on remote work and mental health ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health/data)), consisting of 14 MB of data including demographic information, remote work conditions, and mental health metrics.
- **Technologies:** Python programming tools (Pandas for data analysis, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks), Jupyter Notebook for workflow management.

### Requirements, Assumptions, and Constraints:
- **Requirements:**
  - Ensure thorough cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset to handle missing or inconsistent data.
  - Adhere to ethical data practices, ensuring no personal information is exposed in analysis or visualizations.
  - Completion of the project by December 2024.
- **Assumptions:**
  - Data is representative of a wide range of professions and demographics.
  - Survey responses reflect accurate self-reported experiences.
- **Constraints:**
  - Limited to the Kaggle dataset unless additional datasets can be incorporated within the timeline.
  - Potential biases due to limited or uneven distribution of survey participants.

### Risks and Contingencies:
- **Risk 1:** Insufficient data quality or completeness.  
  **Contingency:** Supplement with additional datasets or restrict the analysis to high-quality subsets.
- **Risk 2:** Overlapping variables or unclear correlations.  
  **Contingency:** Use advanced feature engineering and statistical methods to refine the analysis.

### Terminology:
- **Remote work:** Employment performed outside of a traditional office setting, typically from home.
- **Mental health:** Psychological well-being, encompassing stress, anxiety, and overall satisfaction.
- **Stress levels:** Self-reported indicators of perceived stress due to workload, isolation, or other factors.

### Costs and Benefits:
- **Costs:**
  - Team effort: Approximately 30–40 hours per member for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.
  - Computing resources: Personal computers and open-source software tools (no additional costs).
- **Benefits:**
  - Practical recommendations for employers to improve workplace conditions and employee satisfaction.
  - Insights into the challenges and advantages of remote work, applicable to various industries.

## 3. Defining Data-Mining Goals

### Data-Mining Goals:
1. Analyze and quantify the key factors influencing remote workers' mental health, such as work hours, communication frequency, and personal circumstances.
2. Cluster employee groups based on satisfaction levels to identify those needing additional support.
3. Create visualizations that demonstrate trends and correlations in stress levels across various professions and demographic groups.

### Data-Mining Success Criteria:
- **Quantitative Metrics:**
  - High model accuracy (e.g., >85% for predictive models) in identifying stress-related factors.
  - Clustering analysis that provides clear and interpretable results, distinguishing groups effectively.
- **Qualitative Metrics:**
  - Visualizations that clearly illustrate insights and are easy to interpret for non-technical stakeholders.
  - Actionable findings that align with the stated business goals and support meaningful interventions.
